    <h1>Kubesail Transition</h1>

    <p>Dear Kubesail Community,</p>

    <p>
      We want to take a moment to express our deepest gratitude for your
      support, enthusiasm, and belief in our vision. After much consideration,
      we’ve made the difficult decision to bring Kubesail’s journey as a company
      to an end.
    </p>

    <p>
      While this chapter is closing, the heart of our work—the open-source code
      we’ve developed—remains available to all. The tools and ideas we’ve shared
      will continue to grow and evolve, thanks to the incredible community that
      has always been our foundation. We are proud of the contributions made to
      the wider ecosystem and know they will continue to provide value.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our <a href="https://github.com/kubesail" target="_blank">GitHub</a> will
      remain accessible, and you can continue to connect with us and the
      community on
      <a href="https://discord.gg/gBmxZt2N" target="_blank">Discord</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thank you to everyone who helped make Kubesail what it was. Though our
      path is changing, the work lives on, with a future shaped by you.
    </p>

    <p>
      Warmly,<br />
      The Kubesail Team
    </p>
